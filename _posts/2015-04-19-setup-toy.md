If you just want to play around with it on localhost, there already is a set of config files for doing so.

First, clone the repo, and within the repo root, run


```

go get github.com/Manishearth/cs733/assignment3/raft

cd dash
go build
cd ../server
go build
bash setup_test_servers.sh
```

This will spawn a bunch of servers for testing. Each server will make changes to the `serverN` directory under `server/`, where `N` is the server ID.

You can now run things by running `dash foo` from the `dash` directory.
