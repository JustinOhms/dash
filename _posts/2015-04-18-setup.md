To set up `dash` on the Server, install the "server" package in a folder somewhere, and run it with a configuration.

```
go get github.com/Manishearth/cs733/assignment3/raft
go get github.com/Manishearth/dash/server
go build github.com/Manishearth/dash/server
./server config.json
```

Try to run it in a dedicated directory so that it can create its own files and logs without issue.

`config.json` will have the following format:

```
{
 "Id": 0,
 "Hosts": ["10.2.100.30", "10.2.100.31", "10.2.100.32", "10.2.100.33", "10.2.100.34"],
 "Ports": [8080, 8080, 8080, 8080, 8080],
 "Path": "/home/foobar"
}
```

Make sure there are no trailing commas

Decide an ordering for your servers, and fill in the `Hosts` and `Ports` arrays in that order. You can choose any free port.
`Id` is the index of the server you are currently installing `dash` on in the chosen ordering. `Path` is the path from which all commands should
be run (`dash` is not stateful, and will run each command from this directory by default.)

`Hosts` and `Ports` should be the same on all servers, and `Hosts[Id]` should yield the hostname of the server the config file was found on.

If you wish to try `dash` on localhost, run `test.sh` in the `server/` directory.
